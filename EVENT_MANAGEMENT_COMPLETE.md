## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create Draft Event

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Summer Music Festival",
    "description": "Amazing outdoor concert",
    "venue_name": "Central Park",
    "venue_city": "New York",
    "venue_state": "NY",
    "venue_country": "US",
    "start_time": "2025-07-15T18:00:00Z",
    "end_time": "2025-07-15T23:00:00Z",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "capacity": 5000,
    "category": "music",
    "tags": ["outdoor", "festival", "summer"]
  }'
```

### Example 2: List Published Events

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/events?status_filter=published&limit=20"
```

### Example 3: Search Events

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/events?search=music&category=music&limit=10"
```

### Example 4: Get Event Details

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/events/123"
```

### Example 5: Publish Event

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/events/123/publish" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "is_featured": true
  }'
```

### Example 6: Get My Events

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/events/my/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

## 🔄 Business Logic Flows

### Event Creation Flow

```
1. User registers as promoter
2. Promoter creates event (DRAFT status)
3. Promoter adds ticket tiers
4. Promoter reviews and edits event
5. Promoter publishes event
6. Event appears in public listings
7. Users can purchase tickets
```

### Event Lifecycle

```
DRAFT → PUBLISHED → COMPLETED
         ↓
      CANCELLED
```

**Status Transitions:**
- DRAFT → PUBLISHED: Via publish endpoint
- PUBLISHED → CANCELLED: Via cancel endpoint
- PUBLISHED → COMPLETED: Via complete endpoint or automatic
- DRAFT → CANCELLED: Via delete endpoint (soft delete)

## 🎨 Service Architecture

### EventService Class

**Responsibilities:**
- Event CRUD operations
- Permission verification
- Status management
- Data validation
- Relationship loading

**Key Methods:**
- `create_event()` - Create new event
- `get_event()` - Fetch event by ID
- `list_events()` - List with filters
- `update_event()` - Update event
- `delete_event()` - Soft/hard delete
- `publish_event()` - Publish draft
- `cancel_event()` - Cancel event
- `mark_completed()` - Mark as done
- `_check_event_permission()` - Verify access

### Dependency Injection Pattern

```python
# In route handler
async def create_event(
    event_data: EventCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_promoter_user),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    service = EventService(db)
    event = await service.create_event(event_data, current_user.promoter.id)
    return EventResponse.model_validate(event)
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow

```
Request → Bearer Token → JWT Verification → User Lookup → Permission Check → Route Handler
```

### Authorization Matrix

| Action | Public | User | Promoter | Admin |
|--------|--------|------|----------|-------|
| List events | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View event | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create event | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update own event | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update any event | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Delete own event | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete any event | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Publish event | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cancel event | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests

```python
# Test event creation
async def test_create_event(client, promoter_token):
    response = await client.post(
        "/events",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {promoter_token}"},
        json={...}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json()["status"] == "draft"

# Test permission checking
async def test_update_other_users_event(client, user_token, other_event_id):
    response = await client.put(
        f"/events/{other_event_id}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {user_token}"},
        json={...}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 403

# Test publish validation
async def test_publish_without_tiers(client, promoter_token, event_id):
    response = await client.post(
        f"/events/{event_id}/publish",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {promoter_token}"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert "ticket tier" in response.json()["detail"]
```

### Integration Tests

```python
# Test complete event lifecycle
async def test_event_lifecycle(client, promoter_token):
    # Create
    event = await create_event(client, promoter_token)
    assert event["status"] == "draft"
    
    # Add tiers
    await add_ticket_tier(client, promoter_token, event["id"])
    
    # Publish
    published = await publish_event(client, promoter_token, event["id"])
    assert published["status"] == "published"
    
    # Cancel
    cancelled = await cancel_event(client, promoter_token, event["id"])
    assert cancelled["status"] == "cancelled"
```
