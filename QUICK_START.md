## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### Option 1: Continue with AI Dev Team

Ask me to continue building! Say something like:

```
"Continue building the ticket vendor API. 
Complete the remaining SQLAlchemy models next."
```

Or be specific:

```
"Implement the authentication system with 
JWT tokens, password hashing, and login/register endpoints."
```

### Option 2: Next Development Steps (In Order)

1. **Complete SQLAlchemy Models** (1-2 hours)
   ```python
   # Create these files:
   src/models/promoters.py
   src/models/events.py
   src/models/ticket_tiers.py
   src/models/orders.py
   src/models/tickets.py
   src/models/waitlist.py
   src/models/payment_transactions.py
   src/models/email_notifications.py
   src/models/audit_log.py
   src/models/__init__.py  # Export all models
   ```

2. **Create Pydantic Schemas** (2-3 hours)
   ```python
   # Request/response validation
   src/schemas/auth.py      # Login, register, token
   src/schemas/users.py     # User CRUD
   src/schemas/events.py    # Event CRUD
   src/schemas/tickets.py   # Ticket and tier schemas
   src/schemas/orders.py    # Order and purchase
   src/schemas/waitlist.py  # Waitlist operations
   ```

3. **Implement Authentication** (3-4 hours)
   ```python
   src/core/security.py       # JWT utilities, password hashing
   src/core/dependencies.py   # Auth dependencies
   src/api/auth.py           # Login/register endpoints
   src/services/auth_service.py  # Business logic
   ```

4. **Build Core Endpoints** (4-6 hours)
   ```python
   src/api/events.py         # Event CRUD
   src/api/tickets.py        # Ticket operations
   src/api/orders.py         # Order processing
   src/api/waitlist.py       # Waitlist management
   src/services/*.py         # Business logic services
   ```

5. **Create Main Application** (1 hour)
   ```python
   src/main.py              # FastAPI app initialization
   src/api/__init__.py      # Router aggregation
   ```

6. **Add External Integrations** (3-4 hours)
   ```python
   src/services/payment_service.py  # Stripe integration
   src/services/email_service.py    # SendGrid integration
   src/services/qr_service.py       # QR code generation
   src/core/redis.py                # Redis utilities
   ```

7. **Testing** (3-4 hours)
   ```python
   tests/conftest.py        # Pytest fixtures
   tests/test_auth.py       # Auth tests
   tests/test_events.py     # Event tests
   tests/test_tickets.py    # Ticket purchase tests
   ```

8. **Docker & Deployment** (2-3 hours)
   ```yaml
   Dockerfile
   docker-compose.yml
   .github/workflows/ci.yml  # CI/CD pipeline
   ```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Step

The **highest priority** task is:

### Complete the Remaining SQLAlchemy Models

Why? Because all other development depends on having complete models:
- API endpoints need models to query data
- Pydantic schemas reference models for validation
- Services interact with models for business logic
- Tests need models to create test data

**Just ask me**: "Complete all the SQLAlchemy models for the ticket vendor API"

## 📊 Estimated Completion Time

- **Remaining Development**: 17-25 hours
- **Testing & Polish**: 5-8 hours
- **Total to MVP**: ~22-33 hours

With the AI Dev Team approach, you can complete this in 3-5 focused development sessions!

## 🔑 Key Features Already Designed

Your API will support:

✅ Multi-role authentication (User, Promoter, Admin)
✅ Event creation with rich details
✅ Multiple ticket tiers per event
✅ Race-condition-free ticket purchases
✅ Automatic waitlist management
✅ Stripe payment integration
✅ Email notifications
✅ QR code tickets
✅ Analytics and reporting
✅ Audit logging

## 💡 Tips for Development

1. **Test as You Go**: Create tests alongside endpoints
2. **Use the Swagger UI**: FastAPI auto-generates docs at `/docs`
3. **Check the Logs**: The AI dev team logs all activities
4. **Review the Architecture**: Reference `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for decisions
5. **Database First**: Always refer to `docs/DATABASE.md` for schema
